**LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND WEB DEPLOYMENT USING STREAMLIT**

Our project addresses several gaps in current loan approval prediction methods by thoroughly comparing multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best model, ensuring comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis for high-quality insights. We deploy an interactive and user-friendly web application using Streamlit for real-time predictions, rigorously evaluate model performance with key metrics, and design a scalable solution for easy integration into banking systems. Additionally, our approach focuses on better risk management by identifying high-risk applicants early and enhancing customer experience with quicker, clearer loan decisions
